# AI Assistant Spec — Gema’s Lab

## 🧭 Purpose
Explore how a generative AI assistant can support design, research, and analytical workflows.  
It should remain flexible for general-purpose tasks but include specialized modules for Product Design, UX Research, and creative experimentation.

---

## 🎯 Core Objectives
- Automate repetitive parts of creative and analytical work.  
- Generate ideas, prompts, and prototypes from defined goals.  
- Integrate with tools like Cursor, Claude, and Figma.  
- Learn from personal work patterns and suggest process improvements.

---

## ⚙️ Key Capabilities
1. **Prompt Expansion** – enhance initial ideas and turn them into detailed creative briefs.  
2. **Workflow Orchestration** – help document, structure, and optimize processes (research, ideation, testing, etc.).  
3. **Design Assistance** – suggest layouts, copy, or components for wireframes.  
4. **Experimentation Support** – generate hypotheses, test ideas, and analyze experiment outcomes.  
5. **Knowledge Companion** – search, summarize, and connect relevant sources of information.

---

## 🧩 Example Use Cases
- Automatically create a spec document from a single idea.  
- Design high-quality prompts for different creative goals.  
- Generate structured user research documents.  
- Analyze A/B tests and summarize learnings.  

---

## 🔗 Future Integrations
- **Cursor AI** – for code-guided development and prototyping.  
- **Claude.ai** – for structured documentation and reasoning.  
- **Figma** – for visual ideation and design workflows.

---

## 🧱 Next Steps
- Define base prompt templates (`/prompts/`)  
- Design the first workflow structure (`/workflows/`)  
- Build the first functional prototype (`/prototypes/`)
