**Input Example:**  

Users are confused about how Atida Cash works and whether they can use it immediately.
They hover the tooltip but rarely click.
The term "Cash" makes some think it’s an instant discount, not a reward.


**Output Example:**  

Problem: Confusion about immediacy of Atida Cash.
Solution: Add a tooltip: “Your cashback, available after your next order.”
Why: Clarifies timing and sets correct expectations.

Problem: Low engagement with tooltip.
Solution: Change icon from “i” to a small animated coin that reacts on hover.
Why: Behavioral principle of salience — makes users notice the reward area.

Problem: Misinterpretation of “Cash” as instant money.
Solution: Add a tiny line in basket summary: “Earned for future orders.”
Why: Reinforces concept through repetition at key touchpoints.
