# 🎨 Design Ideation Workflow

## 🎯 Purpose
Facilitate the transition from research insights to design ideas and early prototypes.  
The assistant acts as a creative partner that structures brainstorming and helps prioritize concepts.

---

## 🧩 Steps

1. **Input collection**  
   The user provides insights, pain points, or research summaries gathered from previous research workflows.

2. **Problem statement creation**  
   The assistant helps transform raw insights into structured and actionable problem statements.  
   *Format:* “[User group] struggles to [achieve goal] because [reason].”  
   This ensures clarity before moving into ideation.

3. **How Might We generation**  
   Reformulate each problem statement as a creative question to open up solution space.  
   *Format:* “How might we [enable user] to [achieve goal] despite [barrier]?”  

4. **Idea generation**  
   The assistant proposes multiple solution ideas for each HMW, using frameworks like:  
   - How Might We  
   - SCAMPER  
   - Jobs To Be Done  
   - Design Sprint Ideation  

5. **User stories**  
   For the selected ideas, the assistant drafts user stories to link design intent with user goals.  
   *Format:* “As a [user type], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].”

6. **Clustering and selection**  
   The assistant groups similar ideas and suggests criteria for prioritization (impact, feasibility, effort).  

7. **Concept expansion**  
   Develop the top ideas into structured mini-concepts or low-fidelity prototypes, highlighting problem–solution fit.

8. **Output**  
   Deliver a shortlist of ideas, each with:  
   - Problem statement  
   - HMW question  
   - Solution concept  
   - User story  
   - Suggested next step
