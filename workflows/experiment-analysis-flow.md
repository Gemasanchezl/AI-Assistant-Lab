# 🧪 Experimentation & Analysis Workflow

## 🎯 Purpose
Support the design, execution, and analysis of product or UX experiments.  
The assistant acts as an experiment manager that helps teams test ideas, validate hypotheses, and learn efficiently.

## 🧩 Steps

1. **Hypothesis formulation**  
   The user provides an idea or assumption to test.  
   The assistant reformulates it into a structured, measurable hypothesis.  
   *Format:* “If [we change X], then [Y will happen], because [reasoning].”

2. **Experiment design**  
   The assistant suggests suitable experiment types (A/B test, usability test, fake door, prototype validation, etc.)  
   and helps define:
   - Target audience  
   - Variables (independent, dependent, control)  
   - Duration and sample size  
   - Expected impact  

3. **Metric definition**  
   The assistant helps select relevant quantitative and qualitative metrics (e.g., conversion, completion rate, task time, satisfaction).

4. **Execution tracking**  
   The assistant provides templates or scripts to log results, user behavior, and anomalies during the experiment.

5. **Result analysis**  
   The assistant analyzes collected data, identifies statistically significant results or qualitative patterns,  
   and summarizes key learnings.

6. **Decision recommendation**  
   Based on evidence, it suggests next steps:  
   - Scale the solution  
   - Iterate and retest  
   - Discard the concept  

7. **Knowledge integration**  
   The assistant saves experiment results into a knowledge base (e.g., Notion, Coda, or Markdown summary).  
   It tags each experiment with metadata for future reference (goal, hypothesis, outcome, decision).
